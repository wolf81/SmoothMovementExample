# SmoothMovementExample

This trivial app is an example on how to create smooth moving player characters in a SpriteKit game. I've created this example project to help out with [a question on StackOverflow][0].

P.S. (1): in the Simulator movement might look choppy, but should be fine on a device. 

P.S (2): this app is just a demo. Some things might not be implemented perfectly. Use as reference.
